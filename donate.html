<h2>Why We Chose Bitcoin</h2>

<p>
Newpedia was created with a simple idea in mind: knowledge should be open, accessible,
and independent from centralized control. In a digital world dominated by advertising,
tracking, and opaque algorithms, it becomes increasingly difficult for independent
projects to survive without compromising their values.
</p>

<p>
Bitcoin represents more than a digital currency. It is a monetary network built on
transparency, voluntary participation, and cryptographic truth. By choosing Bitcoin
and the Lightning Network as our funding model, we align the way we receive support
with the principles we believe knowledge should stand on.
</p>

<p>
There is no account to freeze, no intermediary to censor transactions, and no
requirement for users to surrender personal data. A donation is simply value sent
from one individual to another, peer to peer.
</p>

<h2>The Problem with Traditional Monetization</h2>

<p>
Most websites today rely on advertising, data collection, or sponsored content.
While this model may appear “free” to users, the true cost is paid in attention,
privacy, and sometimes even truth.
</p>

<p>
Ads distort incentives. When revenue depends on clicks, outrage and sensationalism
often outperform accuracy and nuance. Data collection erodes trust. Sponsored content
blurs the line between information and marketing.
</p>

<p>
We wanted a different path. One where readers support content because it is useful,
not because they are being tracked or manipulated.
</p>

<h2>Bitcoin as a Tool for Digital Freedom</h2>

<p>
Bitcoin allows value to move across the internet as freely as information. This is
not a small achievement. Before Bitcoin, sending money online required banks,
payment processors, and permission.
</p>

<p>
With Bitcoin, anyone can participate. There are no gatekeepers deciding who is
“bankable” or which countries deserve access. This matters especially for creators
and readers in regions where financial infrastructure is limited or restrictive.
</p>

<p>
By accepting Bitcoin donations, Newpedia remains globally accessible. Support can
come from anywhere in the world, at any time, without friction.
</p>

<h2>The Lightning Network: Making Bitcoin Practical</h2>

<p>
While Bitcoin on-chain transactions are secure and robust, they are not optimized
for small, frequent payments. The Lightning Network solves this by enabling instant,
low-fee micropayments.
</p>

<p>
Lightning allows a reader to support Newpedia with as little as a few satoshis.
There is no minimum donation and no unnecessary overhead.
</p>

<p>
LNURL Pay simplifies this even further. Instead of copying invoices or amounts,
you scan once, choose how much you want to give, and pay.
</p>

<h2>Why LNURL Pay Matters</h2>

<p>
LNURL is an open standard. It is not owned by a company or controlled by a platform.
Any compatible wallet can interact with it.
</p>

<p>
This openness ensures long-term compatibility and avoids lock-in. If one wallet
disappears, the standard remains.
</p>

<p>
For users, LNURL Pay removes friction. For creators, it removes complexity.
</p>

<h2>How Your Support Is Used</h2>

<p>
Every satoshi donated to Newpedia helps keep the platform independent and sustainable.
Funds are used for:
</p>

<p>
• Infrastructure and hosting  
• Research and writing time  
• Tooling and security  
• Long-term preservation of content  
</p>

<p>
There are no shareholders, advertisers, or sponsors to please. The only incentive
is to serve readers better.
</p>

<h2>Why Small Donations Matter</h2>

<p>
You don’t need to send a large amount to make a difference. One of Bitcoin’s most
powerful features is granularity.
</p>

<p>
When thousands of readers contribute small amounts, independence becomes possible
without relying on any single entity.
</p>

<p>
Micropayments enable a healthier relationship between creators and readers:
voluntary, transparent, and aligned.
</p>

<h2>Privacy and Respect</h2>

<p>
Newpedia does not track users, sell data, or profile readers. Donating via Bitcoin
does not require creating an account or sharing personal information.
</p>

<p>
Your support is private, permissionless, and final.
</p>

<h2>The Future of Knowledge Funding</h2>

<p>
We believe Bitcoin-powered funding models represent the future of independent media
and education.
</p>

<p>
Instead of paywalls that exclude, or ads that exploit, we envision a world where
knowledge flows freely and is supported voluntarily.
</p>

<p>
This model scales globally and ethically. It rewards quality over clickbait and
trust over manipulation.
</p>

<h2>A Personal Thank You</h2>

<p>
If you choose to support Newpedia, know that your contribution directly enables
this project to exist.
</p>

<p>
Even if you don’t donate, simply reading, sharing, and engaging with the content
already helps.
</p>

<p>
Bitcoin makes it possible for ideas to be supported directly by the people who value
them. That is powerful.
</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
The internet was meant to be open. Bitcoin helps keep it that way.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for being part of this experiment in independent knowledge.
