<h2>1. What Is Health Insurance?</h2>
<p>Health insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance provider that covers part or all of medical expenses in exchange for regular premium payments. These expenses may include doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, preventive care, and emergency treatment.</p>

<p>The primary goal of health insurance is to reduce the financial burden of healthcare while ensuring access to quality medical services.</p>

<h2>2. How Health Insurance Works</h2>
<p>Policyholders pay monthly or annual premiums to maintain coverage. When medical services are needed, the insurance provider shares the cost based on policy terms such as deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.</p>

<p>Understanding these components helps individuals anticipate out-of-pocket costs and avoid unexpected medical bills.</p>

<h2>3. Types of Health Insurance Plans</h2>

<h3>3.1 Individual Health Insurance</h3>
<p>This type of plan is purchased independently and is suitable for freelancers, self-employed individuals, or those without employer-sponsored coverage.</p>

<h3>3.2 Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance</h3>
<p>Provided by employers as part of employee benefits, these plans often offer lower premiums due to group pricing.</p>

<h3>3.3 Family Health Insurance</h3>
<p>Family plans cover multiple members under a single policy, offering convenience and cost efficiency.</p>

<h3>3.4 Government-Supported Health Insurance</h3>
<p>Many countries offer public or subsidized health insurance programs to ensure access to essential healthcare services.</p>
